⚙️ Export map as JSON or Markdown  
🌐 Add graph-based visualization (Cytoscape.js or D3)  
🧩 Add execution modules for AI agents or CLI commands  

Let me know if you want:

A GitHub Actions CI/CD setup  
A backend API layer  
Local-first persistence  
Voice input  
Just say the word, and I’ll generate it!
