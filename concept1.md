# Concept 1: Mindfreak — AI-Augmented Thought Mapping + Auto-Execution

**Tagline:** Think it. Map it. Run it.

**Core Idea:**  
A mind mapping tool that doesn’t just let you organize your thoughts—it brings them to life by turning mind maps into actionable code, automations, research workflows, or creative outputs.

### Features

- Visual AI-assisted mind map canvas
- Auto-generate action plans from nodes (e.g., “Build AI Agent” becomes a prefilled GitHub repo with tasks and starter code)
- Prompt-aware nodes — each node is a smart prompt space (can chat, code, fetch info, etc.)
- Drag-and-drop to build pipelines — like Zapier or n8n inside a mind map
- Voice-thought transcription — speak your mind, build a structure
- Realtime AI brainstorming assistant
- Execution Layer — connect tools (VS Code, GitHub, Notion, shell scripts) to execute your mind map in the real world

### Target Audience

- Indie developers
- Product managers
- Creative coders
- Thinkers with ADHD or idea overflow

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React or Svelte with D3.js or Cytoscape.js for the map
- **Backend:** Node.js + Python
- **AI:** OpenAI API or Ollama + LangChain
- **Storage:** SQLite / Supabase / Graph database (like Neo4j for relationships)
- **Integration:** GitHub, Google APIs, CLI tooling
