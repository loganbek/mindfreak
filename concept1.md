## Core Idea

Mindfreak is a next-generation mind mapping tool that doesn’t just help you organize your thoughts—it brings them to life. By combining visual mind mapping with AI-powered suggestions and automation, Mindfreak turns your ideas into actionable plans, code, workflows, or creative outputs.

---

## Key Features

- **Visual AI-Assisted Mind Map Canvas:**  
  Create, connect, and organize thought nodes in an intuitive, animated interface.

- **Smart Node Suggestions:**  
  AI recommends related ideas, tasks, or resources as you build your map.

- **Auto-Generate Action Plans:**  
  Instantly turn nodes into actionable checklists, project boards, or even starter code.

- **Prompt-Aware Nodes:**  
  Each node can act as a smart prompt—chat, code, fetch info, or trigger automations.

- **Drag-and-Drop Pipelines:**  
  Build workflows visually, connecting nodes to automate tasks (like Zapier or n8n).

- **Voice Input:**  
  Speak your thoughts and have them transcribed and structured into the map.

- **Execution Layer:**  
  Connect to tools (VS Code, GitHub, Notion, CLI) to execute actions directly from your mind map.
